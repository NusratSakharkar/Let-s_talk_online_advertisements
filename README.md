# Let-s_talk_online_advertisements
This project explores the dynamics of online advertising. We aim to determine which types of ads best endorse products, what factors influence consumer buying decisions, and how different socio-demographic groups respond to various ads. Our goal is to enhance the effectiveness and engagement of online advertising campaigns.
